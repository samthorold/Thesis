Elevator pitch and minimal description of model
----------------------------------------------------------------

A five-factor model comprised of; market, size,  value, cash profitability and momentum factors gives a maximum monthly sharpe ratio of 0.35.
Value and cash profitability have similar marginal contributions to the sharpe ratio of 0.2.
The market and momentum contribute 0.1 while size contributes 0.02.
An investment factor contributes only 0.002 to the maximum sharpe ratio of a six-factor model and it is omitted for parsimony.
The time series regression for the model is
$$
R_{it} = R_{Mt} + s_iSMB_t + h_iHML_t + r_iRMW_t + w_iWML_t
$$ {#eq:mymodel}
where;
$R_{it}$ is the return on asset $i$ for month $t$ in excess of the risk free rate,
$R_{Mt}$ is the return on the value-weighted portfolio of NYSE-AMEX-NASDAQ stocks in excess of the risk free rate,
$SMB_t$ is the return on a portfolio long small stocks and short big stocks,
$HML_t$ is the return on a portfolio long stocks with high book to market equity and short stocks with low book to market equity,
$RWM_t$ is the return on a portfolio long stocks with high accrual adjusted profits and short stocks with low accrual adjusted profits and
$WML_t$ is the return on a portfolio long stocks with high returns over the last twelve months and short stocks with low returns over the past twelve months.
Long-short portfolios are 2x3 sorts in the style of @fama1993common.
Value is created in the style of @asness2013devil and profitability in the style of @ball2015deflating.
Book-to-market and prior return portfolios are sorted every month while size and profitibility portfolios are sorted every June.


Why sharpe ratio? What do we learn?
----------------------------------------------------------

**What are we saying when use a factor model?** Risk-return, mean-variance, risk story (?)

The asset pricing challenge is to describe a small number of observable factors that can come close to spanning an efficient portfolio.
This is equivalent to correctly pricing returns.
Analysis of asset-pricing models typically focusses on the intercepts left in time series regressions.
@jensen1968performance explains that a regression intercept represents an asset's deviation from an asset pricing model.
This method makes it difficult to compare model specifications directly.
How can we compare models which make improvements in some anomalies but perform worse in others?
@barillas2016alpha show that increasing the maximum sharpe ratio of the factors minimizes the maximum sharpe ratio of the intercepts.
Model $M_1$ composed of factors $f_1$ is preferable to model $M_2$ composed of factors $f_2$ if
$$
Sh^2(f_1, f_2, R) - Sh^2(f_1) < Sh^2(f_1, f_2, R) - Sh^2(f_2)
$$
Where $R$ represents test asset returns.
Since both sides measure the improvement in squared sharpe ratio when adding a factor to the set of test asset returns and additional factors,
we can simplify the condition to
$$
Sh^2(f_1, f_2) - Sh^2(f_1) < Sh^2(f_1, f_2) - Sh^2(f_2)
$$
We are able to directly compare nested models of factors by comparing the change in sharpe ratio when adding a factor.

Tests should consider factors' ability to price *all* returns, not just those of another factor.
In practice this means the stock returns available, including portfolio returns we can create with them, *and* the factors themselves.
@barillas2016alpha show that sharpe ratios can be used to compare models of any specification, nested or non-nested.
Our end goal is to minimize the sharpe ratio attainable from the intercepts in a time series regression of all asset returns on our factors.
$$
Sh^2(f, \Pi) - Sh^2(f) = Sh^2(\alpha)
$$
where $\Pi$ is the returns on all assets, $f$ is our set of factors and $\alpha$ is our intercepts.
The returns on all assets includes our factors, so
$$
Sh^2(f, \Pi) - Sh^2(f) = Sh^2(\Pi) - Sh^2(f)
$$
We can minimize the sharpe ratio of the intercepts in a regression on all assets without knowing the returns on all assets by maximizing the sharpe ratio of our set of factors.


A focus on the sharpe ratio of the factors breaks from previous research in three ways;
models can be directly compared,
we no longer emphasise the size of the intercepts but rather their covariance and
we are concerned with a model's ability to explain the returns on all assets rather than a subset of assets.

Similar work
------------------

@fama2016choosing conduct similar analysis and find a sharpe ratio of 0.24 from a similar five-factor model comprised of; market, size, value, cash profitability and investment factors.
$$
R_{it} = R_{Mt} + s_iSMB_t + h_iHML_t + r_iRMW_t + w_iCMA_t
$$ {#eq:FF2016}
where;
$R_{Mt}$, $SMB_t$ and $RMW_t$ are defined as above while $CMA_t$ is the return on a portfolio long stocks with high growth in assets and short stocks with low growth in assets.
$HML$ is created in the style of @fama1993common with annual rebalancing and lagged market equity.

How is this different?
-------------------------------

Value and momentum are persistent global phenomenons (@asness2013value).
Furthermore, value and momentum are negatively correlated (@asness1997interaction).
Negative correlation makes the factors a natural hedge and accentuates their slopes when both included in regressions (@fama2015incremental).
@asness2013devil shows that momentum predicts changes in future book value of equity.
Using a monthly updated price in our calculation of book-to-market equity, we can remove stocks that appear cheap because their book values have not taken into account recent poor results (@kok2017facts). This reasoning leads to the model specified in +@eq:mymodel.
