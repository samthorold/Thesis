Introduction
==========

A five-factor model comprised of; market, size,  monthly value, cash profitibility and momentum factors gives a maximum monthly sharpe ratio of 0.35.
Monthly value and cash profitability have similar marginal contributions to the sharpe ratio of around 0.2.
The market and momentum contribute around 0.1 while size contributes 0.02.
An investment factor contributes only 0.002 to the maximum sharpe ratio of a six-factor model and it is omitted for parsimony.
The time series regression for the model is
$$
R_{it} = R_{Mt} + s_iSMB_t + h_iHML_{mt} + r_iRMW_{ct} + w_iWML_t
$$ {#eq:regmodel}
where;
$R_{it}$ is the return on asset $i$ for month $t$ in excess of the risk free rate,
$R_{Mt}$ is the return on the value-weighted portfolio of NYSE-AMEX-NASDAQ stocks in excess of the risk free rate,
$SMB_t$ is the return on a portfolio long small stocks and short big stocks,
$HML_{mt}$ is the return on a portfolio long stocks with high book to market equity and short stocks with low book to market equity,
$RWM_{ct}$ is the return on a portfolio long stocks with high profits and short stocks with low profits and
$WML_t$ is the return on a portfolio long stocks with high returns over the last twelve months and short stocks with low returns over the past twelve months.
Long-short portfolios are 2x3 sorts in the style of @fama1993common.
Book-to-market and prior return portfolios are sorted every month while size and profitibility portfolios are sorted every June.

@fama2016choosing find a sharpe ratio of 0.24 from a similar five-factor model comprised of; market, size, value, cash profitability and investment factors.
