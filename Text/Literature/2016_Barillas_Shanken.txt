@jensen1968performance explained that a regression intercept represents an asset's deviation from an asset pricing model.
$SMB$, $HML$, etc. are traded factors while Consumption growth is not.
@breeden2005intertemporal suggested that non-traded factors can be replaced with mimicking traded ones.
Significant $\alpha$ means that the maximimum sharpe ratio of the factors used in the regression can be improved by a position in the asset being tested.

The asset pricing challenge is to describe a small number of observable factors that can come close to spanning an efficient portfolio. This is equivalent to correctly pricing returns.
Previous work tests factors' ability to price a small subset of returns, typically "anomalies."
Tests should consider factors' ability to price *all* returns.
In practice this means the stock returns available, including portfolio returns we can create with them, *and* the factors themselves.

It is intereting to note when tests of subsets of asset returns do not point to the same combination of factors as tests involving a more complete set of returns.

@gibbons1989test demonstrate that the possible improvement in the squared sharpe ratio offered by test asset returns is given by the quadtratic form in the $\alpha$s.
This measure of model misspecification shows that test assets are not important when comparing models.

Model $M_1$ composed of factors $f_1$ is preferable to model $M_2$ composed of factors $f_2$ if
$$
Sh^2(f_1, f_2, R) - Sh^2(f_1) < Sh^2(f_1, f_2, R) - Sh^2(f_2)
$$
Where $R$ represents test asset returns.
Since both sides measure the improvement in squared sharpe ratio when adding a factor to the set of test asset returns and additional factors,
we can simplify the condition to
$$
Sh^2(f_1, f_2) - Sh^2(f_1) < Sh^2(f_1, f_2) - Sh^2(f_2)
$$.

> "Thus, the mispricing that matters for model comparison is the mispricing of the factors in one model by the factors in the other model."

The condition can be simplified futher to
$$
Sh^2(f_1)>Sh^2(f_2).
$$
Model comparison can be thought of in terms of investment opportunities.
Whether the model with the the highest squared sharpe ratio is "good" enough depends on performance pricing test assets.
