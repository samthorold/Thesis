Value (@kok2017facts)
----------------------------------

**Value investing** is buying securities  for a good value.
It is not the quantitative strategies of @lakonishok1994contrarian nor @chan2004value which focus on ratios of common fundamental metrics such as book-to-market or price-earnings.
Quantitative strategy proponents claim to identify temporarily underpriced securities^[Do they? Or do they claim it is risk?].

*The common fundamentals approach only works for small stocks*. These stocks tend to be capacity constrained and illiquid.

Instead of identifying underpriced securities, the fundamentals approach identifies securities with inflated accounting numbers.

**Brief History**

@graham1934security said that investors should buy stocks that are trading at a significant discount to intrinsic value.
Where intrinsic value is measured as future earnings power.
Multiples began gaining traction in the 1980s.
High book-to-market stocks began being referred to as "value" stocks in @fama1992cross.
Indexes popped up representing different "styles" such as the Russel value index among others.
Academics and practitioners found that these indexes were not amazing (@loughran1997book and @asness2015fact).
In fact, fundamental value has gotten weaker since publication (@mclean2016does).

Returns to fundamental value is concetrated in small high-growth stocks with short sale constraints (@nagel2005short).

Construction of common 2x3 factors equal weight small and big halves which overweights small stocks^[Does it? They're zero investment portfolios].

Value indexes often underperform their standard counterparts.

If fundamental value does not identify underpriced securities what does it identify then?

- Fundamental metric in the numerator represents intrinsic value
- The price in the denominator tells us how much we have to pay for that intrinsic value
- A high ratio therefore implies a "cheap" security

A high fundamental value measure may revert to intrinsic value for one of two reasons;
a price increase (what investors want) or
a decrease in the fundamental numerator (@graham1934security warning) because the security was not cheap

Fundamental ratios exhibit mean reversion
$$
\frac{F_{t+1}}{P_{t+1}}=\frac{F_t}{P_t}\cdot\frac{F_{t+1}}{F_t}\cdot\frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t}
$$
taking logs
$$
ln\left(\frac{F_{t+1}}{P_{t+1}}\right) =ln\left(\frac{F_t}{P_t}\right) +ln\left(\frac{F_{t+1}}{F_t}\right) -ln\left(\frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t}\right)
$$
The ending ratio value equals the beginning value plus the change in the fundamental metric minus the change in the price.

**Fundamental Value and Momentum**

Positive momentum stocks exhibit less mean reversion.
That is to say they exhibit smaller reductions in the fundamental metric.
By using a combined fundamental value and momentum strategy one weeds out stocks that recently had bad news that is not yet reflected in accounting numbers.
A book-to-market measure is useful *if* one can back out expected changes in book equity.
Unfortunately this requires perfect foresight.
HML-Momentum is a compromise.
