\subsection{Anomalies}

Once we have used the Sharpe ratio to identify our preferred model, anomaly regressions
can provide useful insights into specific cases where the model performs poorly. The
p-value of the GRS statistic of \textcite{gibbons1989test} gives a probability that all of
the test assets jointly have zero alphas. Almost always, the GRS p-value rejects the
hypothesis that all alphas are jointly zero. I focus on the GRS itself rather than the
p-value because the GRS gives a measure of how much the factors can be improved by
including the test assets in the model -- this is more useful than finding every model is
wrong. As B2016 omits the investment factor, I first turn to sorts on size and investment
to make sure we have not lost any performance compared with the FF2016 model. I sort on
size-value and size-B/M-investment to check that the poor perfomance of value in large
stocks \parencite{asness2015fact} does not lead to poor performance of the model in larger
stocks. Sorts on volatility \parencite{ang2006cross} and momentum
\parencite{jegadeesh1993returns} have been shown to cause problems for the FF2016 model
\parencite{fama2016dissecting}. I check the performance of the B2016 model when explaining
returns on these two anomalies. As well as highlighting deficiencies in individual
portfolios, anomaly regressions will show where value and momentum slopes of B2016 differ
from the investment slopes of FF2016.


Utlimately, B2016 performs much better explaining ``home" sorts than FF2016 while also
maintaining performance on FF2016's turf as well as other known troublesome sorts. B2016
struggles most where value and momentum get in each other's way. Problem sorts are made
less of a problem, although the problems remain in the familiar portfolios that share the
``lethal combination" of small, unprofitable stocks that invest aggressively.
