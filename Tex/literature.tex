\section*{Prior Research}

\textcite{fama2016choosing} show that adjusting profitability for accruals in
the style of \textcite{ball2016accruals} improves the Sharpe ratio of the
five-factor model of \textcite{fama2015five}.
The model has the time series regression form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:F16}
R_t^i = a^i+b^iR^M+s^iSMB_t+v^iHML_t+p^iPMU_t+i^iCMA_t
\end{equation}
where $CMA$ is the return on a portfolio long conservatively investing stocks
and short aggressively investing stocks mimicking the investment premium.
The investment factor is rebalanced annually.
The remaining factors are as described in model \ref{eq:B16} except value is
rebalanced annually.
Fama and French rely heavily on \textcite{barillas2016alpha} who explain we can
compare the ability of a model to describe the returns on all assets by
comparing the Sharpe ratio of the factors.
The level of mis-pricing for a set of test assets is given by the quadratic
form in the alphas.
This measure gives the amount the squared Sharpe ratio can be improved by
investing in the test assets as well as the factors.
The relationship is given by
$a'V_ea=Sh^2\left(R,f\right)-Sh^2\left(f\right)$
where $a$ is the vector of alphas,
$V_e$ is the covariance matrix of the residuals,
$Sh^2\left(\cdot\right)$ is the maximum squared Sharpe ratio,
$R$ is the matrix of test asset excess returns and $f$ is the matrix of factor
returns.
The key insight from Barillas and Shanken is that
$Sh^2\left(R,f\right)=Sh^2\left(R\right)$ if $R$ is the returns on all assets.
We can write the level of mis-pricing for all assets as
$a'V_ea=Sh^2\left(R\right)-Sh^2\left(f\right)$ because our factors, $f$, are
contained in the set of all assets, $R$.
We do not need to identify all the components of $R$ to minimize the
mis-pricing given by the quadratic form of the alphas.
We only need to maximize the squared Sharpe ratio of the factors.
Assuming the maximizing portfolio is on the positive portion of the efficient
frontier, this is the same as maximizing the Sharpe ratio.
I follow the bootstrap procedure of \textcite{fama2016choosing} to show the
investment factor does not improve the Sharpe ratio of model \ref{eq:B16} and
that model \ref{eq:B16} has a higher Sharpe ratio than model \ref{eq:F16}.

\textcite{fama2016dissecting}, following the advice of
\textcite{lewellen2010skeptical}, test model \ref{eq:F16}'s ability to
describe the returns on anomalies created from sorts on variables not used to
create the factors.
They find that many anomalies share the same factor loadings.
The anomaly returns behave like the returns on small, unprofitable stocks that
somehow invest aggressively.
I find that such sorts behave like the returns on small, unprofitable stocks
with poor recent performance.

\textcite{fama2006profitability} use the dividend discount model to link the
profitability and investment anomalies to firm value.
With cleans surplus accounting, the dividend discount model sayd that market
equity equals discounted expected future earnings less the change in book
equity,
$ME_t = \sum_{s=1}^\infty E(Y_{t+s}-\Delta BE_{t+s})/R^s$
where $Y$ is earnings and $R$ is the gross discount rate.
Fama and French use change in assets in place of change in book equity.
With sorts on value and investment, I show that change in assets and change in
book equity move in opposite directions for small, growth stocks.

I use the value factor specification of \textcite{asness2013devil}.
They propose a more timely measure of B/M than prior research and update the
factor monthly.
Consider a stock that has just had a positive return, all else the same, we
expect the B/M to descrease.
Annually rebalanced value will stay the same while monthly rebalanced value
will reflect this change.
The power of using a more timely measure is not simply more frequent updating.
Both \textcite{asness2013devil} and \textcite{kok2017facts} find that monthly
value has greater power to identify those stocks that will change B/M through
a change in market equity, driving returns, than book equity.
Monthly value has particular strength when combined with momentum.
Momentum is the tendency of stocks with higher (lower) recent returns than
their peers to continue to outperform (underperform) in the short term
\parencite{jegadeesh1993returns} and has been found in markets all over the
world \parencite{asness2013value}.
I measure momentum as the previous year's return not including the most recent
month \parencite{fama2016dissecting}.
Value and momentum enhance each other's slopes in time series regressions.
Any two variables that are negatively correlated with each other but positively
correlated with the independent variable will exhibit this effect
\parencite{fama2015incremental}.
I use sorts on value and momentum to show their strength is not just
statistical but also through their ability to forecast changes in book equity.
Sorts on value and momentum create variation in investment and book equity
characteristics.
Value and momentum factors describe the returns on the investment anomaly
better than value and investment factors.

The specification of profitability is important as \textcite{ball2015deflating}
show that the denominator can influence a ratio's predictive power as much as
the numerator.
\textcite{fama2006profitability} suggest net income scaled by book equity (OP).
Their measure struggles to explain the returns on the accruals anomaly of
\textcite{sloan1996stock}.
\textcite{novy2013other} points out that net income contains accounting
captions that are not strictly to do with firm profitability.
For example, interest expenses contain information regarding firm structure.
Novy-Marx suggests gross profits scaled by total assets (GP).
He finds this measure interacts with value to provide a measure of quality.
Combining B/M with GP helps to indicate stocks that are ``cheap" and ``good".
\textcite{ball2016accruals} explain that investors are concerned with the cash
flows to a firm.
We return to OP but we adjust for accruals as these are the non-cash
components of financial statements.
They show that
the Sharpe ratio of a five-factor model created by including CP in the
four factor model of \textcite{carhart1997persistence} cannot be
improved by an accruals factor.
I use their balance sheet adjusted CP specification rather than the cash flow
statement adjustment as balance sheet data is available for the entire sample.
Ball et al. test a model similar to mine except they rebalance value annually.
I take advantage of the interaction between monthly value and momentum.
