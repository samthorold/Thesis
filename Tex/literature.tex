\subsection{Assorted Ramblings}

The consumption models performs poorly during significant downturns.
Momentum experiences crashes \parencite{daniel2016momentum}.
$SMB$, $HML$, etc. are traded factors while Consumption growth is not.
\textcite{breeden2005intertemporal} suggests that non-traded factors can be replaced with 
mimicking traded ones.
Significant $\alpha$ means that the maximum Sharpe ratio of the factors used in the regression 
can be improved by a position in the asset being tested.
Construction of common 2x3 factors equal weight small and big halves which 
overweights small stocks. \textbf{Does it? They're zero investment portfolios}.
