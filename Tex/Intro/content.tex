\begin{itemize}
  \item From asset pricing to obsession with risk story with returns
  \item Characteristics vs. risk
  \item Compensation for risk vs. tail risk
  \item Varying factor loadings over time | ``dynamic" models
  \item Problems for risk story | quality and momentum
  \item F\&F's refusal to consider momentum until 2016. Not considered because a $WML$ 
  factor does not add explanatory power to factor models. Sorts on other characteristics
  do not produce variation in momentum. By construction we have made a $WML$ factor
  rubbish but this does not mean momentum is not important. If we constructed portfolios
  to have no variation in size then a size factor would be rubbish but that does not mean
  size is not important
  \item Does basing everything on Sharpe-Lintner mean we are in a risk-story world before
  we even consider the validity of behavioural stories?
  \item Gibbons, Ross and Shanken test $H_0$: Excess returns are jointly zero
