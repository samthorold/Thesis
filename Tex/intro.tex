%\section*{Introduction}

An asset’s price equals its expected risk adjusted future payoff. The risk
adjustment is driven by the covariance of asset payoffs with marginal utility.
The intertemporal CAPM (ICAPM) of \textcite{merton1973intertemporal} says that
investors are not just concerned with the level of payoff in the future but
also what consumption and investment opportunities are available when they
receive the payoff. \textcite{fama1996multifactor} explains that ICAPM
investors worry about the covariances of returns with the market and multiple
state variables.

Asset-pricing models that focus on stock returns use portfolios, ``factors", to
mimic unobserved priced state variables. The prevalence and
quality of stock data can quickly lead to data-mining in the search for
factors. Many factors are based largely on statistical anomalies rather than
economic intuition. \textcite{harvey2016and} find more than 300 factors in the
literature and call for an increase in the usual confidence intervals used to
class a new factor as ``discovered”. \textcite{mclean2016does} find that the
unexplained return on many factors is reduced following publication suggesting
the factors were not truly priced by investors.
Subsets of stocks that cannot
be priced by a set of factors are important for academic and professional
reasons, but statistical anomalies should not drive the choice of factors.

The ultimate goal of an asset-pricing model is to minimize mis-pricing for
\emph{all} assets. \textcite{barillas2016alpha} explain that maximizing the
Sharpe ratio of factors minimizes mis-pricing for all assets. Ranking models on
Sharpe ratio of the factors before testing performance in subsets of stocks
promotes a top-down approach favouring economic intuition over statistical
anomalies.

I apply investing intuition in a diversified way to make mimicking factors for
priced state variables. \textcite{graham1934security} advocate buying cheap,
profitable stocks. I measure how cheap a stock is by the book-to-market ratio
(B/M). \textcite{kok2017facts, asness2013devil} show that updating B/M monthly
and using the measure alongside momentum helps to identify those stocks that
will revert to their mean value through a change in market equity
, driving returns, rather than book
equity. I measure momentum as the return over the previous year omitting the
most recent month \parencite{fama2016dissecting}. I measure profitability as
the accrual-adjusted operating income \parencite{ball2016accruals}.

I propose a five-factor model of market, size, value, momentum and
profitability factors with time series regression form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:B16}
R_t^i = a^i+b^iR^M+s^iSMB_t+v^iHML_t^m+m^iWML_t+p^iPMU_t 
\end{equation}
where $R_t^i$ is the excess return on asset $i$ at time $t$, $a$ is the
regression intercept and unexplained return left by the factors, $R^M$ is the
excess return on the market, $SMB$ is the return on a portfolio long small
stocks and short big stocks mimicking the size premium, $HML$ is a portfolio
long value stocks and short growth stocks mimicking the value premium, $WML$ is
a portfolio long past winners and short past losers mimicking the momentum
premium and $PMU$ is a portfolio long profitable stocks and short unprofitable
stocks mimicking the profitability premium. Lower-case letters are regression
coefficients. Value and momentum are rebalanced monthly while size and
profitability are rebalanced annually. This specification has a higher Sharpe
ratio of the factors than the recent five-factor model of
\textcite{fama2015five}, including when momentum is added to the Fama and
French specification. I show that the investment factor is made redundant by
the interaction of value and momentum through their ability to forecast future
changes in book equity. Value and momentum are negatively correlated and this
relationship is a statistical slam dunk in a regression context
\parencite{asness1997interaction, fama2015incremental}. Their relationship with
book equity shows that value and momentum's interaction is more than just
statistical.

While the Sharpe ratio of the factors indicates the best overall model, there
may be subsets of stocks for which the best overall model performs poorly. The
GRS statistic of \textcite{gibbons1989test} indicates how much the Sharpe ratio
of a set of factors can be improved by investing in the test assets. GRS
evidence broadly, but not always, matches Sharpe ratio evidence. I compare the
GRS statistics of different specifications of model across different test
assets to highlight the problems caused by momentum and volatility.

I use individual portfolio regressions for problem sorts identified by the GRS
statistic to investigate the factor loadings that lead to problems. I compare
non-nested model specifications to show where value and momentum slopes differ
from the subsumed investment slope. Regression slopes do not always match
characteristic sorts. The model performs poorly where value is constrained or
disappears. The offending sorts share the ``lethal” combination of small,
unprofitable stocks that somehow invest aggressively identified in
\textcite{fama2015five, fama2016dissecting}. These sorts behave like small,
unprofitable stocks with poor recent returns.
