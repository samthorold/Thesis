**1.** I present evidence that, without constraints on factor loadings, the cash profitability five factor model [@fama2016choosing] outperforms a gross profitability [@novy2013other] and value-momentum [@asness2013devil] six factor model.
Imposing common industry constraints reveals that the six factor model is preferable in practice.
To guard against data-mining [@harvey2016and], I present evidence that the six factor model outperforms principal component factors [@kozak2017interpreting] for out-of-sample returns.

**2.** The cash profitibility factor of [@fama2016choosing] combined with the value-momentum factor [@asness2013devil] improves on the performance of the five factor model when explaining returns on various "anomalies." In particular the differences in performance when explaining the returns on small, heavily investing firms with low profitability help to shed light on the "lethal" combination of negative $RMW$ and $CMA$ loadings.

**3.** I show results from two common tests of semi-strong and strong form market efficiency.
Tests of modern variants of the ICAPM [@merton1973intertemporal] suggest that the "state-of-the-art" still lacks sufficient explanatory power to be considered the optimal risky portfolio [@fama2017international].
Event studies around earnings announcements suggest that not all available information is reflected in stock prices immediately and that IPOs are overpriced.
