\section{WRDS Data Codes and Variable Definitions} \label{sec:datasuppl}

Return data is from CRSP and fundamental firm data is from COMPUSTAT.
I combine the datasets with the \texttt{PERMNO} (CRSP) and \texttt{LPERMNO} 
(COMPUSTAT)identifiers.
I include all stocks with share code (\texttt{SHRCD}) 10 or 11.
Where possible, data codes are taken from prior research.
I use judgment when authors do not explicitly state the data codes.

\subsection{Data Codes} \label{sec:datacodes}

COMPUSTAT Codes;
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{at}: Total Assets
  \item \texttt{act}: Total Current Assets
  \item \texttt{ch}: Cash (not including Short-term Investments)
  \item \texttt{xpp}: Prepaid Expenses
  \item \texttt{invt}: Total Inventory
  \item \texttt{rect}: Total Receivables
  \item \texttt{lt}: Total Liabilities
  \item \texttt{lct}: Total Current Liabilities
  \item \texttt{ap}: Accounts Payable - Trade
  \item \texttt{drc}: Deferred Revenue
  \item \texttt{xacc}: Accrued Expenses
  \item \texttt{dlc}: Current Portion of Long-term Debt
  \item \texttt{seq}: Stockholder's Equity
  \item \texttt{ceq}: Book Value of Common Equity
  \item \texttt{txditc}: Deferred Taxes
  \item \texttt{pstkrv}: Preferred Stock (PS), Redemption Value
  \item \texttt{pstkl}: PS, Liquidation Value
  \item \texttt{pstk}: PS, Book Value
  \item \texttt{upstk}: PS, ???
  \item \texttt{revt}: Total Revenue (This is the same as \texttt{sale} for US firms)
  \item \texttt{cogs}: Cost of Goods Sold
  \item \texttt{xsga}: Selling, General and Administrative
  \item \texttt{xrd}: Research and Development Costs
  \item \texttt{xint}: Total Interest Expenses
\end{itemize}

CRSP Codes;
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{EXCHCD}: Exchange Code (1-NSYE, 2-AMEX, 3-NASDAQ)
  \item \texttt{PRC}: Share Price
  \item \texttt{SHROUT}: Number of Shares Outstanding
  \item \texttt{RET}: Monthly Return
  \item \texttt{DLRET}: De-listing Return
  \item \texttt{vwretd}: Value-weighted Return (including distributions)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Variables} \label{sec:variables}

\textbf{Market Equity}
\[ME = SHROUT \cdot abs(PRC) / 1000\]
\textbf{Monthly Return}
\[RET = (1 + RET) * (1 + DELRT) - 1\]
\textbf{Book Equity}
\[BE = seq + txditc - ps\]
where $ps$ equals (in order of preference); $pstkrv$, $pstkl$ or $pstk$.
If all measures of preferred stock are missing,
\[BE = ceq + upstk\]
if we still do not have a value for $BE$,
\[BE = at - lt\]
\textbf{Profitability}
\[OP = (revt - cogs - xsga - xint)/BE\]
\textcite{fama2016choosing} add back research and development costs to $OP$,
\[OP_r = (revt - cogs - xsga - xint + xrd)/BE\]
\[CP = (revt - cogs - xsga - xint + xrd + acc)/BE\]
where (\parencite{ball2016accruals})
\[acc = -\Delta rect -\Delta invt -\Delta xpp +\Delta drc +\Delta ap +\Delta xacc\]
\textbf{Investment}
\[INV = (at_t - at_{t-1})/at_{t-1}\]
