\section{Data}

Where possible, data for factors and anomalies are taken from Ken French's 
website\footnote{mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/}.
All factors except cash-profitability and monthly value are available.
All anomalies are available except for those using cash-profitability as one of the sort 
variables.
I use data from WRDS to construct missing factors.
A full list of data codes can be found in appendix (\ref{sec:datacodes}).
