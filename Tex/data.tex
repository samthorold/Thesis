\section{Data}

Where possible, data for factors and anomalies are taken from Dr. Kenneth French's 
website\footnote{mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/}.
I use data from WRDS to construct missing factors.
A full list of data codes can be found in appendix (\ref{sec:datacodes}).
I examine the period from July, 1963 to December, 2015.
