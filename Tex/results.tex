Table \ref{tbl:Sh2} shows the maximum squared Sharpe ratio and the factor contributions for 
the models in equation \ref{eq:tsmodel} and the cash-profitability model in 
\textcite{fama2016choosing} (FF2016).
For both models, $Prof$ refers to the cash profitability factor of \textcite{ball2016accruals}.
For (\ref{eq:tsmodel}), $Val$ refers to the monthly, current value of 
\textcite{asness2013devil}.
$Prof$ and monthly, current $Val$ are created manually.
All other factors are as specified in \textcite{fama2016dissecting} and straight from Ken 
French's 
website.
The maximum Sharpe ratio is calculated as $Sh^2(f)=R'V^{-1}R$ where $R$ is the vector of mean 
returns on the factors and $V$ is the covariance matrix for the returns on the factors.
Contributions to the total Sharpe ratio are calculated as $(\alpha_i / \sigma_i)^2$ where 
$\alpha_i$ is the intercept from regressing the factor $i$ on the remaining factors and 
$\sigma_i$ is the standard deviation of the residuals from the same regression.

The Sharpe ratio of (\ref{eq:tsmodel}), 0.348, is higher than that of FF2016, 0.246.
The investment factor contributes only 0.003 to \ref{eq:model} while the momentum factor 
contributes 0.014 to FF2016.
