\subsection{Factors}

\import{./Tables/}{My_Factors}
Table \ref{tbl:MyFactors} shows the mean, standard deviation and t-statistic for
replicated small and big components of factors that can be found on Ken French's Dartmouth
website. Factors are the average of the small and big components. The returns on the large
value and investment portfolios are insignificant. In general, the returns on the large
portfolios are not high enough and this drives low returns on the factor.

\subsection{25 Size-Value Sorts}

\import{./Tables/}{25_Size_Value_FF2015_196307_201312}
Table \ref{tbl:25_Size_Value_FF2015} shows the regression coefficients for the five-factor
model of \textcite{fama2015five} using replicated factors an anomaly portfolios. The main
message of the table matches that of factors available at Ken French's website. The
intercept of -0.2 above is slightly lower in magnitude than the -0.29 found when Ken
French's data is used.
