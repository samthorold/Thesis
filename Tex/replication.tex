Table \ref{tbl:replicated_factors} shows summary statistics for constructed and
online factors.
The main message of the table is that my results can be believed.
Values should be compared to Kenneth French's website for all factors except
$HML^m$, which should be compared to data available from AQR Captial Management.
All factors are significant and highly correlated with their ``true" online counter-parts.
