\section{Method}

All the factors I use, except for the market premium, are zero-investment, long/short 
portfolios.
They are formed by ranking stocks on size and one other characteristic.
I follow the procedure in \textcite{fama1992cross}, and countless subsequent papers, and use 2 
by 3 sorts.
Annualy rebalanced portfolios are held from July of year $t$ to June of year $t+1$.
I refer to this as a ``return year", \texttt{Ryear} in the code.
I outline the steps here to highlight assumptions.
All code is available and the comments provide a fuller description of my steps.
To prepare the COMPUSTAT data; remove duplicate $PERMNO$-$fyear$ pairs, create the variables 
from section \ref{sec:variables}, lag the data one year by setting $Ryear$ to $fyear+1$ and 
join the COMPUSTAT data to the CRSP data using $LPERMNO$ and $Ryear$.
To prepare the CRSP data; update the return values for de-listing returns using \texttt{ret = 
(1+ret) * (1 + dlret) - 1}, take $ME$ from June for each firm and set it to $Size$ for the 
entire return year. Finally, adjust the $Size$ value for the cumulative return over the return 
year. We hold the number of stocks constant but the return over the period will alter the 
weight in the portfolio.
