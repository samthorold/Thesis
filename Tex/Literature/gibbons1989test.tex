If we accept that returns are produced by a multivariate linear equation
\[
r^i_t = a^i + b\cdot f + e^i
\]
where; $r^i_t$ is the return on asset $i$ at time $t$, $f$ is set of returns on our factors, 
$b$ is set of coefficients from a regression of $r$ on $f$, $a$ is the intercept for asset $i$ 
and $e$ is the residuals.
Then all expected returns should equal the expected returns on the factors times by the 
coefficients.
\[
E(r) = b\cdot E(f)
\]
This gives us a null hypothesis, $H_0$, that $a=0$ for all assets.

We can test this joint hypothesis with Hotelling's rule.
This gives us a non-central F-distribution.
Blah...

The point is that
\[
a'Ea = Sh^2(R, f) - Sh^2(f)
\]
This is way close to our
\[
a'Ea = Sh^2(R) - Sh^2(f)
\]
