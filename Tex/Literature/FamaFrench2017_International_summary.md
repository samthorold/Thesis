*International tests of a five-factor asset pricing model* 

Internationally, profitability and value effects are stronger among small stocks.
Investment does not vary substantially among large stocks and the factor is driven by the underperformance of small aggressively investing stocks.
Global factors perform poorly in tests of regional portfolios.
For the 1990-2015 period the investment factor is redundent in Europe and Japan.
The "lethal" combination of small, aggressively investing stocks with low profitability are a problem globally.
This mirrors results in @fama2015five.

The five factor model is motivated by the dividend discount model but this does not rule out the CAPM.
Consequently, we are not able to say any more about the CAPM cannot explain premiums related to value, profitability and investment.
The dividend discount model does not specify whether premiums are rational or irrational.
Many clever models^[See @lewellen2010skeptical and @kozak2017interpreting] actually do not have a stance on rational vs. irrational pricing.

By and large, all asset pricing models are weak representations of reality.
We cannot even test if they are ultimately true.
All we can test is their empirical robustness with observable asset prices.
A small set of portfolios that describe a large portion of asset returns is useful in practice.
Factor models can be used to evaluate portfolio performance.
They are not as strong when estimating the cost of capital because betas vary through time [@fama1997industry] and standard errors are often large.
