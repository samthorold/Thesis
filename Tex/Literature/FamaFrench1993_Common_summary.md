*Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds* 

**Market, size and value are common risk factors across stocks.**
Market beta seemed to have little to do with average returns.
Size, leverage, earnings-price and book-to-market all seem to be related to average returns.
@fama1992cross find that size and book-to-market absorb the roles of leverage and earnings-price.

If assets are priced rationally, variables that are related to average returns must proxy for sensitivity to shared, and therefore undiversifiable, risk in returns.
Fama and French use the time series regression approach of @jensen1972capital instead of the cross-section regression approach of @fama1973risk.
Time series regression slopes show whether risk mimicking portfolios capture variation in stock returns.
Excess returns are regressed on excess returns or zero investment portfolios.
If the RHS factors capture all non-diversifiable risk then the intercept from the regressions should be zero [@merton1973intertemporal].

Size and book-to-market factors explain the differences in average returns across stocks while the market factor explains the difference in average returns between stocks and the risk free rate.
Including size and book-to-market factors leaves market slopes close to 1.
