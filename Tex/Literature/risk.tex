\subsection{Risk vs Behavioural Stories}

Zero-investment mimicking factors are investable strategies which are not secret.
In fact, \textcite{mclean2016does} find that strategies tend to lose power after publication.
This, along with the many factor-based products available in the market, suggests that 
investors are using the strategies.
How do they continue to generate returns if ``everyone" knows how to implement the strategy 
and it is actually possible to do so.
Fama and French would argue this is because the strategies capture some sort of underlying 
risk.
Others, such as Thaler, would argue that returns are generated by irrational behaviour.
\textcite{cochrane2011presidential} points out that behavioural stories do no explain 
covariance.
For example, why do momentum stocks move up and down together?
