\subsection{Intuition vs. Statistics}

\textcite{kozak2017interpreting} show that factor models composed of a small number of
principal-component (PC) factors performs similarly to our intuition-based factors in
regressions on the returns used to extract the components. This is a novel approach but it
is harder to give PC-factor loadings intuitive meaning. The second and third components
extracted from 25  size-value portfolios are similar to the size and value factors. We can
only make this comparison because we have the intuition-based factors to compare with.
Furthermore, it would be hard to improve the maximum Sharpe ratio of a set of factors in
this  fashion. Completely statistics-based factors encourage data-mining.

Data mining is a problem for test assets \parencite{lewellen2010skeptical} and factors 
\parencite{harvey2016and}.
