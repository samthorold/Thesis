\section{Background}

There has been an explosion in models and factors over the last twenty years. Alongside
the rapid increase in documented factors, new ways to test how ``good" a model is have
been developed. The number of factors is so large that \textcite{harvey2016and} identify
over 300 factors and call for new statistical thresholds using multiple testing intuition
common in medical studies. The explosion has led to a somewhat eclectic collection of
literature with very little replication or out-of-sample testing. I outline some of the
most important models, tests of mis-pricing and the literature regarding the factors I
have chosen. Harvey, Liu and Zhu call for a statistical solution to the plethora of new
factors. I believe we must return to intuition-based factors. Any mis-pricing we find must
then be explained using economics rather than swept under the rug with the creation of a
new factor.
