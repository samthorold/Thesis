90\% confidence intervals of the distributions of Sh2(Row)-Sh2(Column) from
100,000 bootstrap simulations. Each bootstrap sample is 654 months drawn
randomly with replacement from the 654 months of July 1963-December 2017. In
each bootstrap sample Sh2(f) is computed for the seven models of Panel A. Panel
B shows the matrix of the 5th and 95th percentiles (the 90\% confidence
interval) of the bootstrap distributions of Sh2(Row)-Sh2(Column), the
difference between Sh2(f) for the row model and Sh2(f) for the column model.
When the 5th and 95th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution of
Sh2(Row)-Sh2(Column) are positive, Sh2(Row) is greater than Sh2(Column) is at
least 90\% of simulation runs, and the 1963-2017 actual Sh2(f) for the row
model is reliably higher than the 1963-2017 actual Sh2(f) for the column model.
When the 5\textsuperscript{th} and 95\textsuperscript{th} percentiles of the
bootstrap distribution of Sh2(Row)-Sh2(Column) are negative, Sh2(Row) is less
than Sh2(Column) is at least 90\% of simulation runs, and the 1963-2017 actual
Sh2(f) for the row model is reliably less than Sh2(f) for the column model. At
the end of each June, NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks are allocated to two Size
groups (small and big) using the NYSE median market-cap breakpoints. Stocks are
allocated independently to three B/M groups (low to high), using NYSE
30\textsuperscript{th} and 70\textsuperscript{th} percentile breakpoints. The
intersections of the two sorts produce six value-weight Size-B/M portfolios. In
the sort for June of year t, B is book equity at the end of the fiscal year
ending in year t-1 and M is market cap at the end of December of year t-1. I
use Compustat data to compute book equity, defined as (1) stockholders' equity
(or the par value of preferred plus total common equity or assets minus
liabilities, in that order) minus (2) the redemption, liquidation, or par value
of preferred (in that order) plus (3) balance sheet deferred taxes. HML is the
average of the returns on the two high B/M portfolios from the 2x3 sorts minus
the average of the returns on the two low B/M portfolios. The profitability and
investment factors, PMU (profitable minus unprofitable) and CMA (conservative
minus aggressive), are formed in the same way as HML, except the second sort
variable is operating profitability or investment. Cash profitability, used to
create PMU, in the sort for June of year t is measured with accounting data for
the fiscal year ending in year t-1 and is revenue minus the cost of goods sold,
minus selling, general, and administrative expenses, minus interest expense,
plus research and development costs, minus accruals all divided by book equity.
Investment, Inv, is the change in total assets from the fiscal year ending in
year t-2 to the fiscal year ending in t-1, divided by t-2 total assets. The
momentum factor, WML, is defined in the same way as HML, except the factor is
updated monthly rather than annually. To form the six Size- Prior 2-12
portfolios at the end of month t-1, Size is the market cap of a stock at the
end of t-1 and Prior 2-12 is its cumulative return for the 11 months from t-12
to t-2. Monthly value, $HML^m$, is defined in the same way as WML except book
equity is only updated at the end of June.
