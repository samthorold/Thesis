Table \ref{tbl:Size_BMm_Prior} shows 32 time series regressions from
Size-$\text{BM}^{m}$-Inv portfolios using B16 and F16 factors.
The main message of the table is that small, unprofitable growth firms have a
sizeable alpha of -0.66\% per month for B16 and -0.91\% per month for F16.
This portfolio shares the negative slope coefficients on profitability and
investment in F16 dubbed the ``lethal" combination by Fama and French.

For B16, value slopes increase with value buckets and prior buckets.
This is different from the characteristic sorts in table
\ref{tbl:Size_BMm_Prior_chars} where value decreased with prior buckets.
Characteristic sorts are not bound to multivariate regression coefficients, but
a model will struggle to describe the returns on sorts where characteristics do
not match regression slopes.
Sorting on value as well as prior returns revives the value factor in the
small, low-prior bucket that disappeared in the sorts on size and prior returns
alone.

For F16, the profitability factor does most of the work describing the returns
on the small, low-value, low-prior bucket, although a very large alpha of -0.91
is left unexplained.
Profitability's power to describe returns on this bucket, even in the presence
of value and momentum in B16, suggests a shared story for the low returns to
small, growth firms with poor recent results.
Following from the findings in the size-prior sorts in table
\ref{tbl:Size_Prior}, profitability slopes suggest returns on extreme buckets
of momentum behave like volatile stocks.
Table \ref{tbl:Size_BMm_Prior} shows that this is a particular problem for
growth stocks.

To take advantage of the alpha in the small, low-value, low-prior bucket, an
investor has to sell stocks whose returns behave like those of small, growth
firms with poor recent performance.
Short selling small firms is more difficult than short selling larger firms
even without considering recent poor performance.
