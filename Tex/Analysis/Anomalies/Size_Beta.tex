Table \ref{tbl:Size_Beta} shows 25 time series regressions from size-beta
portfolios using B16 and F16 factors.
The main message of the table is that sorts on beta are not a problem for B16.
Momentum slopes pick up the slack left in F16 to drive out the alphas in the
low-beta bucket.
The shared story between momentum and beta points to a shared story between
momentum and volatility.

There is only one intercept in the 25 portfolios, in the big, third beta
bucket. This does not have any apparent economic meaning and may be purely
statistical. Looking at table \ref{tbl:GRS}, we see that the size-beta sorts
cause the least problems of all the sorts.
Beta's lack of mischief is important because of the historical stubbornness of
the anomaly and beta's relationship with volatility.
The ``flatness" of the relationship between beta and return
\parencite{jensen1972capital} is what kicked off the search for factors beyond
the market risk premium.
Shortly afterwards, we had the size anomaly of \textcite{banz1981relationship}
and many more followed as detailed earlier in the paper.
Despite the explosion of factors, the flat-beta anomaly stuck around
including up to a recent analysis in \textcite{fama2016dissecting}.
Furthermore, beta and volatility are related because the variance of a stock
drives its covariance with the market.
Table \ref{tbl:Size_Beta} shows the beta anomaly is not the problem is once
was thanks to momentum.
Nevertheless, we are not off the defensive-equity hook that the profitability
slopes in table \ref{tbl:Size_Prior} suggest we might be on.
We still need to examine idiosyncratic volatility.
