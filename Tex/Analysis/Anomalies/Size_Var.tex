Table \ref{tbl:25_Size_Var_B16} shows 25 time series regressions from size-
variance sorts for model \ref{eq:B16} while table \ref{tbl:25_Size_Var_F16}
shows the same regressions for model \ref{eq:F16}. The main message of the
table is that the ``lethal combination" of small, unprofitable stocks that
somehow invest aggressively is described by stocks whose returns behave like
those of small, unprofitable stocks with recent poor performance. What is in
this new description of problem sorts is just as important as what is not --
there is no value. Those sorts that create problems for \ref{eq:B16} have
returns that do not covary with the returns on the value factor.

I include the market and size slopes, despite their similarity across models,
because they show volatility's relationship with market beta and size. Beta
increases as volatility buckets increase and remains flat across size buckets.
This relationship with beta makes sense given individual stock, or portfolio,
variance drives covariance with the market. Size slopes increase with
volatility buckets.
In the smallest two size buckets, the variation in size
slopes is extreme.
For model \ref{eq:B16}, the smallest size bucket slopes rise from 0.63 to 1.5
and the second size bucket slopes rise from 0.51 to 1.18.
Value slopes are also similar across models.
For both models, low-variance stocks have positive value slopes so
the returns on low-variance stocks behave like the returns on value stocks.
There is a drop in value slopes for the high-variance bucket so
the returns on high-variance stocks behave like the returns on growth stocks.
The value slope is insignificant in just one bucket for both models -- small,
high-variance stocks.
Profitability slopes tell a similar story across both models,
although the profitability factor does much more of the heavy lifting for model
\ref{eq:F16} in the absence of momentum.
Profitability slopes are positive for the low-variance bucket and negative for
the high-variance bucket.
The returns on low-variance stocks behave like those of profitable stocks.
This relationship is consistent with findings in
\textcite{novy2014understanding} and earlier findings that momentum sorts
may be identifying volatile stocks through their profitability slopes.
For model \ref{eq:B16}, momentum slopes are negative for the high-variance
bucket.
The returns on high-variance stocks behave like the returns on stocks with poor
recent returns. 
For model \ref{eq:F16}, investment has very little to add for sorts on
variance.
The small, high-variance intercept is large for both models.
The intercept is -0.66\% per month for model \ref{eq:B16} and -0.8\% per month
for model \ref{eq:F16}.
The improvements for model \ref{eq:B16} are from the negative momentum factor
slopes where the investment factor has nothing to add (t-stat=-1.25) to model
\ref{eq:F16}.

To take advantage of the alpha in the small, high-variance bucket of table
\ref{tbl:25_Size_Var_B16} an investor has to sell stocks whose returns behave
like those of small, unprofitable firms with poor recent performance.
Intuitively, this is a tough sell.
Such stocks are likely to be more illiquid than than big, profitable stocks
with strong recent performance.
Small stocks are likely to be held by fewer institutional investors or
``market makers".
\textcite{nagel2012evaporating} uses the short-term reversal strategy to proxy
for the returns to market makers who represent the largest group of buyers for
these ``problem" stocks.
Furthermore, Nagel finds liquidity measured in this way is related to the
aggregate level of volatility as proxied for by the VIX.
\textcite{nagel2005short} ...
These liquidity explanations are not satisfactory from a cross-section
perspective and often focus on market microstructure, for example Nagel's
measure of institutional ownership.
Furthermore, \textcite{ang2006cross} test many possible liquidity
explanations\footenote{for example, blah, blah and blah}
for the volatility anomaly and find none help greatly to describe the returns
on highly volatile stocks.

  \item Consumption and SDF
  \item If I plot my SDF from optimal factor weightings what does it do in
  downturns or periods of deep value?
  \item If I plot the residuals from small, high-variance regression, what are
  they doing in downturns or periods of deep value?
