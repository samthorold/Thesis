Tables \ref{tbl:25_Size_Prior_B16} shows 25 time series regressions from size-prior
portfolios using B16 factors. The main message of the table is that the two intercepts
largest in magnitude are found in the buckets where value is insignificant. Performance is
poor where the model cannot leverage the interaction between value and momentum. Value is
largely insignificant in the low-Prior and high-Prior buckets. This makes sense for the
high-Prior bucket as value is weakest among high-Prior stocks and vice-versa. It is more
of a puzzle why value is insignificant in the low-Prior bucket.

The B16 models struggles most with the high-Prior bucket with three significant intercepts
out of five. Momentum slopes behave as expected increasing as Prior buckets increase and
increasing slightly with size. Profitability slopes exhibit a frown shape suggesting the
returns on stocks in the low-Prior and high-Prior buckets behave like the returns on
unprofitable firms.
