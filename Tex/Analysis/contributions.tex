Table \ref{tbl:contributions} shows the spanning regression intercepts,
$a$, standard deviation of residuals, $\sigma_e$ and contributions,
$(a/\sigma_e)^2$ to $\text{Sh}^2$ for B16, B16b and F17 models.
The main message of the table is that the intuition of buying cheap profitable
stocks is supported by the equal contributions to $\text{Sh}^2(\text{B16})$,
0.18, of value and momentum.

The data for B16 shows the largest contributions to $\text{Sh}^2$ are from
value and momentum at 0.18.
The market and momentum have similar contributions, 0.1 and 0.11 respectively.
Size makes a small contribution of 0.03.
The contribution from value is driven by unexplained average return of 1\% per
month dampened by unexplained variation of 2.36.
The contribution from profitability is driven by low unexplained variation,
1.17, rather than the modest unexplained average return of 0.5\% per month.

The data for B16b shows the largest contribution is from profitability at 0.18.
In the presence of investment, value, at 0.11, has a similar contribution to
the market, 0.1, and momentum, 0.09.
The reduction in value's contribution is driven by the lower unexplained
average return, 0.59\% per month, but mitigated somewhat by the reduced
unexplained variation, 1.83.
Both reductions are driven by value's strong correlation with investment.
The slope attentuation described in \textcite{fama2015incremental} causes the
spillover effect seen in the small reductions to unexplained average returns
and variation for momentum.
The negligible contribution from investment is driven by the small unexplained
average return of 0.01\% per month.

The data for F17 shows the largest contribution is from profitability at 0.14.
The market and size maintain their contributions, at 0.08 and 0.03
respectively, but value and momentum see large reductions in contribution to
0.03 or below.
This brings them inline with investment's contribution.
Value and investment are strongly correlated and this drives the low
unexplained average return of 0.33\% per month.
Without the interaction between monthly value and momentum, the variables
cannot benefit from slope enhancement that helps the contributions in B16 and
B16b.

Profitability has the highest contribution to $\text{Sh}^2$ in all three
models.
Given the low correlation between investment and profitability it is unlikely
that profitability causes the investment factor to be redundant.
I run time series regressions of investment on selected other factors to see
which factors subsume investment.
