Table \ref{tbl:contributions} shows the spanning regression intercepts, standard deviation
of residuals and contributions to maximum Sharpe ratio for the B16b and F17 models. The
main message of the table is that combining monthly value with momentum gives value a much
greater contribution to the maximum squared Sharpe ratio in B16b, 0.18, than annual value
in F17, 0.03. Given the similar contributions from the market, size, profitability and
investment factors, the interaction between value and momentum accounts for the higher
Sharpe ratio of B16(b). The investment factor adds nothing to the B16 model,
$(a/\sigma_e)^2$ is 0, and adds very little to F17, $(a/\sigma_e)^2$ is 0.01, but we want
to know which other factors make the investment factor redundant.
