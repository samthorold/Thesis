Table \ref{tbl:bootstrap} shows the 90\% confidence intervals for 100,000 bootstrap
simulations of the difference in squared Sharpe ratio between the model in the row and the
model in the column. The main message of the table is that including the investment
factor, $CMA$, in the B16 model does not reliably improve the Sharpe ratio of the factors
(the 90\textsuperscript{th} percentile of $Sh^2(B16b)-Sh^2(B16)=0$).
