Table \ref{tbl:replicated_factors} shows summary statistics for selected \emph{replicated}
factors. The factors shown demonstrate annual and monthly rebalancing portfolios for those
factors not available online or for variables that I use to produce my own sorts. The main
message of the table is that my results are not garbage. Values should be compared to Dr.
Kenneth French's website for all factors except the monthly value factor which should be
compared to data available from AQR Captial Management. All factors are significant,
t-statistics above 2 and highly correlated with their ``true" online counter-parts.

The largest problems are caused by the investment factor with an average return of 0.22\%
per month. The average return is 7 basis points below the factor available on Dr.
Ken's, although the correlation between my factor and Dr. Ken's is 0.96. This correlation
is lowest of the factors I could find online counter-parts for. All factors I use are from
online sources except for the cash-profitability factor, $PMU$.
